      <p>
        I am a main contributer to the vial design and rotation mechanism CAD. As we moved into V2 of the OpenCAL design, I worked with other students to make the rotation mechanism simpler and less prone to error. I helped to eliminate wobble of the system that existed in V1 and designed an effective top plate for the motor mount.

        A parametric CAD model was created to allow rapid iteration and evaluation of
        multiple geometries.

      <h2>Assembly</h2>
      <p>
        While assembling the current model, I helped to reflect on the problems with wobble that existed in V1. Although V2 has not yet been finalized in assembly form, I helped to produce a prototype version of the design, with the changes that we implemented in the CAD.

      <h2>Prototyping</h2>
      <p>
        While improving the rotation mechanism and vial subassembly, I contribute to many different prototype efforts. Our group discussed many different variations that seeked to eliminate the wobble, ultimately landing on something simple, yet effective, using bearings to allow the vial to rotate while constraining planar motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final design achieved a greater reduction in wobble, a smoother interface with the motor plate, and a simpler way to insert the vial.
