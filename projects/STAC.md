      <h2>CAD</h2>
      <p>
        While the CAD for the CubeSAT was mostly finished upon me joining the team, I worked to refine it and clean it up, as well as creating documentation for it. I also created professional engineering drawings for subassemblies of the CubeSAT.

      <h2>Assembly</h2>
      <p>
        I was a main contributer to the assembly and disassembly of the CubeSAT. I was a lead supervisor of the process, making sure that things were assembled correctly and in a timely manner. I also helped to document how assembly should be done so that other students could assemble the CAD correctly.

      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p>
        I have contributed to multiple different tests to prepare the satellite for launch. The most notable tests include vacuum testing (shown), vibration testing, and charge-discharge testing. These helped us to prepare the satellite for launch and to assure that it would survive and function in space.
