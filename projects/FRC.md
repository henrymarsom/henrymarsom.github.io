        This project focused on the design and validation of a load-bearing bracket
        subjected to static loading conditions. The objective was to minimize material
        usage while maintaining structural integrity and an adequate safety factor.
      </p>
      <p>
        A parametric CAD model was created to allow rapid iteration and evaluation of
        multiple geometries.

        Finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted to evaluate stress concentrations
        and deformation under worst-case loading scenarios. Boundary conditions and
        material properties were selected to closely represent real-world use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Results were assessed using von Mises stress criteria and compared against
        allowable material limits to ensure a safety factor greater than 2.

        Based on analysis results, geometry refinements were implemented to reduce mass
        while preserving structural performance. Fillet radii and thickness
        distributions were adjusted to mitigate peak stresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final design achieved a material reduction of approximately 18% while
        maintaining all structural requirements.
