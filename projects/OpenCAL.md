      <h2>CAD</h2>
      <p>
        This project focused on the design and validation of a load-bearing bracket
        subjected to static loading conditions. The objective was to minimize material
        usage while maintaining structural integrity and an adequate safety factor.
      </p>
      <p>
        A parametric CAD model was created to allow rapid iteration and evaluation of
        multiple geometries.

      <h2>Assembly</h2>
      <p>
        Finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted to evaluate stress concentrations
        and deformation under worst-case loading scenarios. Boundary conditions and
        material properties were selected to closely represent real-world use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Results were assessed using von Mises stress criteria and compared against
        allowable material limits to ensure a safety factor greater than 2.

      <h2>Prototyping</h2>
      <p>
        Based on analysis results, geometry refinements were implemented to reduce mass
        while preserving structural performance. Fillet radii and thickness
        distributions were adjusted to mitigate peak stresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final design achieved a material reduction of approximately 18% while
        maintaining all structural requirements.
