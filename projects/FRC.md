    A collection of the designs and subsystems that I led during my time on 1678 Citrus Circuits

      <h2>End Effector</h2>
      <p>
        The end effector on our 2025 competition robot, this mechanism was designed to effectively score both "algae" and "coral" game pieces. It rotated around a dead axle using max composite plate material in order to create a flexible and stress resistant scoring mechanism. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The end effector went through 10+ iterations and involved many different prototypes and approaches.

      <h2>Game Piece Shooter</h2>
      <p>
        The shooter on our 2024 competition robot, this mechanism used 4" compliance wheels to launch and spin the "note" game piece. It acted on a dead axle, rotating to launch the game piece at different angles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shooter went through many different iterations, moving from conical wheels to one-sided wheels. It also changed from a herringbone gear setup to a rack and pinion-like system.

      <h2>Intake</h2>
      <p>
        The intake on our 2023 offseason robot, this mechanism rotated using a live axle powered by dual gear trains each connected to motors. It intook the "cube" game piece with sets of 2" compliance wheels, and was capable of launching the game piece as well.
